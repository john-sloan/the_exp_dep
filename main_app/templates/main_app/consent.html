            <p class="information-sheet-b"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Title:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An investigation into the response of native and non-native speakers to change in facial expression of a 3D avatar to their typed sentences. </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-b"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Topic:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second Language Acquisition, Computational Linguistics, Multimodal Communication</p>
            <p class="information-sheet-b"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Institution:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UCD Computer Science</p>
            <p class="information-sheet-b" style="margin-bottom: -20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Researcher:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Sloan </p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb"> What is this research about? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">I am studying language learning and emotions. I want to understand the difference between how language learners and native speakers feel when they see different facial expressions in a 3D avatar.</p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb">Why are you doing this research? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p"> I believe facial expressions are a very important means of non-verbal communication. I want to understand what language learners think when they see different expressions and use this to help people acquire languages.</p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb"> Why have I been invited to take part? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">This study is open to all native English speakers and non-native English learners of intermediate ability and up.</p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb">What will happen if I decide to take part in this research study? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p"> You will take a 15-minute quiz which has 2 sections: first, you will answer some questionson emotion & language; and second, you will type 6 sentences while you can see the facial expressions of an avatar.</p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb"> How will the data be used? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">I will use your answers from the questions to understand your English ability and what you think of the avatarâ€™s expressions. I will use the sentences you typed on computer to understand how you change your language production after seeing various expressions.

            <p class="information-sheet-pb"> How will you protect my privacy? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p"> This study is anonymous. You should not enter your real name or the names of others while taking part.</p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb">How is this research funded? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">This project is partly funded through the ADAPT centre. ADAPT reviews papers in advance of submission to conferences/journals in case there are any opportunities to protect/commercialise the research. </p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb">What are the benefits of taking part in this research study? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">You will be able to practice your English. You will interact with an avatar who responds to your sentences.</p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb">What are the risks of taking part in this research study? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">If you see negative expressions from the avatar you may feel bad. </p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb">Can I change my mind at any stage and withdraw from the study? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">Yes. You can change your mind anytime and withdraw with no disadvantage. </p>

            <p class="information-sheet-pb">Has this research project received ethical approval? </p>
            <p class="information-sheet-p">Yes. Approval from the UCD Human Research Ethics comittee was granted on 25/01/2017.</p>
